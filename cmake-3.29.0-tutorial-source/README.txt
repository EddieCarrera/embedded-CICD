This directory contains source code examples for the CMake Tutorial.
Each step has its own subdirectory containing code that may be used as a
starting point. The tutorial examples are progressive so that each step
provides the complete solution for the previous step.

**Hint**
Each individual project can be run using the following commands:
mkdir StepX_build
cd StepX_build
cmake ../StepX
cmake --build .
